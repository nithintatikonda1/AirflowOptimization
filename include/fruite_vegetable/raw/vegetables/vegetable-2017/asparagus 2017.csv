"1Includes green asparagus. It is assumed that fresh asparagus is cooked prior to consumption. The USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) indicates that preparing one ounce of raw asparagus yields 14 grams of cooked vegetable, indicating a preparation yield of about 49 percent. This accounts for both the removal of inedible butt ends as well as cooking loss.",,,,,,,

"2Includes green asparagus. The liquid contents of the can are discarded prior to consumption. Based on the Food Patterns Equivalents Database (FPED), ERS assumes that 65 percent of the can's gross weight is solid and 35 percent is liquid medium. The FPED cup equivalent weight for canned asparagus is the weight of the solids and not of the liquid medium in which the vegetable is packed. The preparation yield factor for canned asparagus in the above table does not account for any further preparation that occurs prior to consumption.",,,,,,,
