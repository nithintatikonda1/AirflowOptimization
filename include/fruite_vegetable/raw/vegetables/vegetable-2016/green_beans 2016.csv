"2The liquid contents of the can are discarded prior to consumption. Based on the Food Patterns Equivalents Database (FPED), ERS further assumes that 65 percent of the can's gross weight is solid and 35 percent is liquid medium. The FPED cup equivalent weight for canned green beans is the weight of the solids and not of the liquid medium in which the vegetable is packed. The preparation yield factor for canned green beans in the above table does not account for any further preparation that occurs prior to consumption.",,,,,,
